# Capstone Proposal

  Using MongoDB and Java I intend to develop a user interface that allows for all CRUD
(create, read, update, delete) operations on objects stored in the database. The database will
be created using MongoDB. MongoDB is a no-SQL database where all objects are primarily
stored as jSON. My editor of choice for Java is IntelliJ Idea. Initially I was going to use Postgres
SQL and the SQL Driver. After some research it appeared apparent that for what I was trying to
accomplish is much better using MongoDB than Postgres. The MongoDB Java driver also
appears superior to the SQL Java driver.
At its most basic the project an employee Management System. However, there are
several tasks that I wish to accomplish during this project.

• Learn MongoDB/Java and how they can be used together to create and manage a
database.

• User level Permissions. A regular employee would not have the same access that a
supervisor would.

• Authentication to login to the application

• A proper GUI that allows for the ease of use of the application.

• Properly update values with UI using CRUD

• Ensure al updates are atomic.

• Possible concurrency issues with multiple programs running.

  My inspiration for this project is that my workplace still uses paper for scheduling,
requesting time off, etc. By completing this project, I hope to improve my skills as a Java
programmer, learn MongoDB and proper use of no SQL databases, and create something that
a business could possibly even utilize. If time permits I would like to make a fully integrated
employee desktop application.
